        <h2>I'm Emily (she/they) &#x2014 writer, teacher, storyteller, public transport enthusiast, and future software developer!</h2>
        <p>In 2017, when working as a primary teacher in North London, I introduced my students to Minecraft Hour of Code, and discovered I enjoyed it even more than the Year 4s. For a couple of years, whenever I had an existential crisis, I'd search out coding bootcamps. In 2019, I even went to some sessions at Founders and Coders. But I'd never had a desk job before, and I wasn't sure I was ready to commit (pun intentend).</p>
        <p>After a lot of teaching educational workshops from home during the pandemic, I decided to switch to working for the Learning and Development Team in a Charity. Though I found most of the work frustrating, the part of the job I loved was creating elearnings. Though I wasn't using code, I would need to program each element of the elearning to do exactly what I wanted for the user to interact with it. I could spend entire days absorbed in the work, not even realising how much time had gone by. This is when I started to realise that software development might be the career for me.</p>
        <p>After coming to F&C meet-ups (particularly the support circle) and working through the application projects, I'm even more convinced that this is the right choice for me. I don't think I've ever found any work quite as satisfying as writing some code and having it work.</p>
