        <h2>
          I'm Emily (she/they) - writer, teacher, storyteller, public transport
          enthusiast, and future software developer!
        </h2>
        <p>
          In 2017, when working as a primary teacher in North London, I
          introduced my students to Minecraft Hour of Code, and discovered I
          enjoyed it even more than the Year 4s. For a couple of years, whenever
          I had an existential crisis, I'd search out coding bootcamps. In 2019,
          I even went to some sessions at Founders and Coders. But I'd never had
          a desk job before, and I wasn't sure I was ready to commit (pun
          intentend).
        </p>
        <p>
          After a lot of teaching educational workshops from home during the
          pandemic, I decided to switch to working for the Learning and
          Development Team in a Charity. Though I found most of the work
          frustrating, the part of the job I loved was creating elearnings.
          Though I wasn't using code, I would need to program each element of
          the elearning to do exactly what I wanted for the user to interact
          with it. I could spend entire days absorbed in the work, not even
          realising how much time had gone by. This is when I started to realise
          that software development might be the career for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          After coming to F&C meet-ups (particularly the support circle) and
          working through the application projects, I'm even more convinced that
          this is the right choice for me. I don't think I've ever found any
          work quite as satisfying as writing some code and having it work.
