# My website
## Created as part of my Founders & Coders application

This website displays a bit about me, my history, interests and reason for applying for founders and coders. It all shows off a bit of my visual style and provides links to my projects. 

### Features

- a header and a space underneath with information about me
- attempts at semantic HTML for clarity
- a bus blind that updates when clicked
- a line-diagram style menu map that displays different information when events are clicked via event listeners
- a flexbox with four cards that grow, shrink and wrap as the screen is resized 
- a button that expands and shrinks each box when pressed, and gives more information about each project
- a link to each project's github repository (with the exception of Code Wars that links to my profile)

### Process

This website was built in various stages over the course of me learning basic coding over the past six months. It also incorporates the gallery I created as part of my previous application in order to showcase my work.

As this was a learning process, there are things in it that I would change if I were to do over again. For example, I now know that using 'onclick' elements in HTML is not best practice, and would have used event listeners throughout instead. I also realise, upon looking at the code for my gallery with much greater experience now, that I added style elements to the HTML, thinking this was how it needed to be done in order to toggle appearance. I now know that this should be done in the CSS like any other style elements, but I left this in because it was part of the learning process.

I like the website stylistically and am particularly pleased with the gallery and the bus blind and/line diagram info section. I feel the top of the page is a bit more static than I would like, but I've struggled to find a way to make it more dynamic and interesting and still convey as much information. If I were to work more on the website this is something I'd like to look at.

I also find the buttons on the gallery that allow the user to view more information could use improvement. In the existing form they scroll offscreen sometimes, and because they're different sizes I find it a bit messy. With more time and experience I would have liked to find a better way to do this.
