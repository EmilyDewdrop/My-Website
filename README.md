# My website
## Created as part of my Founders & Coders application

This website displays a bit about me, my history, interests and reason for applying for founders and coders. It all shows off a bit of my visual style and provides links to my projects. 

### Features

- a header and a space underneath with information about me
- attempts at semantic HTML for clarity
- a bus blind that updates when clicked
- a line-diagram style menu that displays different information when 'stops' are clicked via event listeners
- a flexbox with four cards that grow, shrink and wrap as the screen is resized 
- a button that expands and shrinks each box when pressed, and gives more information about each project
- a link to each project's github repository (with the exception of Code Wars that links to my profile)
- specific optimisation for the devices that can be tested for on Google Chrome (and devices of similar sizes)

### Process

This website was built in various stages over the course of me learning basic coding over the past six months. It also incorporates the gallery I created as part of my previous application in order to showcase my work.

As this was a learning process, there are things in it that I would change if I were to do over again. For example, I now know that using 'onclick' elements in HTML is not best practice, and would have used event listeners throughout instead. I also realise, upon looking at the code for my gallery with greater experience now, that I added style elements to the HTML, thinking this was how it needed to be done in order to toggle appearance. I now know that this should be done in the CSS like any other style elements, but I left this in because it was part of the learning process.

At the time I started to make this, I also had less understanding of the difference between classes and IDs than I do today. Therefore there are some areas where I used multiple classes instead of just using ID. As my confidence with Javascript and DOM manipulation grew, I understood the importance of using IDs. You can see that some elements that were needed as part of my javascript were swapped to IDs, where others were left as classes that, should I start this from scratch, would also be IDs.

### Reflections

While I love bold colours and wanted to incorporate them into this website, I feel it works better in some places than others. I also find that the top half which is all HTML and CSS looks, understandably, more dated and less interesting than the bottom. I'd like to make the top more dynamic, maybe featuring a carousel of images or options for the user to click through the text.

The other thing I would like to improve is the bus stops click-through section. While I love the way it looks on a desktop/laptop, it doesn't give a very good user experience on mobile as it involves too much scrolling and while I had a few ideas of how to make improvements, I wasn't sure any of them would be that effective. 

I think both of these things are just a result of being new to coding, and with more experience and learning would be things that I would instinctively know how to solve.
